It's been just a bit over 2 months since we started OpenDialog development and a few days we tagged version 0.4 of [OpenDialog Core](https://github.com/opendialogai/core/releases/tag/0.4.0). This means that all the major components are in place and we can focus on improvements and fixes on specific aspects instead of across the board architecture changes. 

To celebrate we also put together a simpler way to try OpenDialog that saves you configuring and managing all the individual pieces. This OpendDialog app will be the starting point for OpenDialog application development moving forward. It will configure a couple of conversations for you, setup webchat and webchat testing page, setup Dgraph and populate it. 

Head to Github and download the [OpenDialog](https://github.com/opendialogai/opendialog) app. This is our starting point for OpenDialog chatbots. It uses [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io) to give you a development environment with all the components already setup so you can try out a conversation immediately.

Our goal with OpenDialog is to built a conversation management platform that actively helps you build better conversations. It does that by providing all the tooling out of the box, providing a solid conceptual framework that both conversation designers and developers can use and by separating conversational flow from conversational content. However, we will be taking this a step further and making OpenDialog a pro-active participant in conversation design, giving advice about how to build better conversations and also making it simpler to test different versions of conversations so you can optimize to your need.  

## Ok - so how do I keep up?

We will be regularly sharing pieces of the work as it is ready for wider consumption.

We are more than happy to jump on a call and show you what we have so far and get comments.
