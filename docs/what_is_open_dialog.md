## A Conversational Management Platform

**OpenDialog** is a conversational management platform. It enables teams to spin up and run [conversational applications](conversational_applications.md) that integrate with other systems. 

To achieve this OpenDialog provides:

- a specific and opinionated approach to [designing conversations](conversational_model.md).
- a development framework for [building conversational applications](installing_opendialog.md).
- a web-based application for managing conversational applications. 

At the practical level, OpenDialog is a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application with a MySQL backend for user management and content management and a [Dgraph](https://dgraph.com) backend (a graph-based database written in Go) for conversation management and conversational analytics. 

OpenDialog also provides a Vue.js-based webchat widget so that you can place chatbots on your websites and can integrate with any conversational platform (from Slack to Microsoft Teams and from Alexa to Google Assistant).

OpenDialog provides support for integration with NLP systems for intent interpretation.
