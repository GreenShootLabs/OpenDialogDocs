## A Conversational Management Platform

**OpenDialog** is a conversational management platform. It enables teams to spin up and run complex chatbots that integrate with other systems. 

To achieve this OpenDialog provides:

- a specific and opinionated conceptual approach to modelling conversations.
- a development framework for developing conversational applications.
- a web-based application for managing conversational applications. 

At a practical implementation level, OpenDialog is a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application with a MySQL backend for user management and content management and a [Dgraph](https://dgraph.com) backend (a graph-based database written in Go) for conversation management and conversational analytics. 

OpenDialog also provides a Vue.js-based webchat widget so that you can place chatbots on your websites and can integrate with any conversational platform (from Slack to Microsoft Teams and from Alexa to Google Assistant).

There are different paths into OpenDialog depending on what you are trying to achieve.
