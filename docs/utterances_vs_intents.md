An utterance is when a user says something like:

\- Please create a new task checklist.
 
The _intent_ of this utterance is to command an application to create a new task checklist.

The user could have also said:

_\- Create me a new list_

or 

_\- Start a checklist_

or 

_\- Get a checklist going_

All these different utterances map to the same intent.
