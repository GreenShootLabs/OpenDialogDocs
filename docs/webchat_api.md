## Webchat API documentation

The webchat API is documented in APIary [here](https://opendialog.docs.apiary.io/)

As well as full documentation for the 3 main endpoints (`webchat-config`, `chat-init` and `incoming`) APIary provides a mock endpoint that you can consume straight away.
The URL for this is:

`https://private-anon-0d1d684d92-opendialog.apiary-mock.com`
